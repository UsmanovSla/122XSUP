Data extraction from a website using Web scraping or gathering information from the data that are stored in different formats (JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.).\n","\n","2. **Transform** - Tarnsforming the data means removing the data that we don't need for further analysis and converting the data in the format that all the data from the multiple sources is in the same format.\n","\n","3. **Load** - Loading the data inside a data warehouse.
